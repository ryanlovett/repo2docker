System - Specifying runtime environments
----------------------------------------

You can specify runtime environments (such as Python 2 or 3) with a
``runtime.txt`` file.

This is an example that selects Python 3. Currently you can not use
this to select a sepcific version of Python 3 (e.g. 3.4 vs 3.6). If you
need this level of control we recommend you use a `environment.yml`.
